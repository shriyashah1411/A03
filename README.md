c.	Follow the instructions given on the downloads page.
2.	WebStorm - Install WebStorm using the following link: https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/  Make sure to download it through the student license section for the free version. Carefully follow the given instructions and remember to install the correct version of WebStorm that is compatible with your Operating System. To connect GitHub with WebStorm, we will first need to first setup Git in WebStorm. Press (Ctrl+Alt+S) for system preferences.
f.	Select Version control Git. Enter the path to the git.exe
3.	GitHub - This is an online website so there is no need to install anything. Open and register an account at https://github.com/join

	Once you make the GitHub account and setup Git in WebStorm, we will have to connect out WebStorm to GitHub.
	To do that, go to System preferences by pressing (Ctrl+Alt+S).
	Go to Appearances & Behavior > System Settings > Passwords
	In Passwords, add the GitHub password location.
	Once this is done, your WebStorm is connected to your online GitHub account.

	To Make a Repository on GitHub: 
o	Click the + sign on the top right corner to create a new repository.
o	Make sure the repository is set to Public so that everyone can view it.
o	Be sure to add a READ.md file which usually contains the summary of the projects.
	To use the repository in WebStorm:
Select VCS and then select Import Version Control.
Select checkout.
Enter the name of your repository name and the local path name on your computer.

	To add your code to Git:

Glossary:
1.	Branch: A branch is a copy of a repository that exists in two places at the same time. It is stored within the main repository, but it does not disrupt the actual version. 
2.	Clone: It is a copy of your actual repository but is stored on your computer locally.
3.	Commit: all the changes to your file in the repository need to be committed for it to be saved. It can be used to keep record of your previous versions of the file.
4.	Fetch: This downloads everything (files and the commits) from the actual repository to a local repository.
5.	GIT: Git is a software used to work collaboratively with other coders but is also used for tracking changes on a file.
6.	GitHub: GitHub is a git repository service that provides a online platform for coders to keep their codes.
7.	Merge: It literally means “merge”. It merges the change in multiple files into one single file.
8.	Merge Conflict: It is called merge conflict when the Git software cannot automatically fix the differences into multiple files of code.
9.	Push: used to push or upload the files from your local repository to your online GitHub repository.
10.	Pull: used when fetching for changes made in a file or folder.
11.	Remote: This is a version of a file/folder that is hosted on a server. It can be connected to local clones. This helps to sync the changes across the folders.
12.	Repository: The storage space where directories are saved and can be edited.
